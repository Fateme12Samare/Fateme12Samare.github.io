ChatGPT said:
Fateme Samare Hedayatzade is an artist born in 1992 in Kerman, Iran. She holds a master's degree in pure mathematics and began her artistic journey after moving to Paris in 2016. Influenced by the city's rich art and culture, she explored various media, including oil paints, colored pencils, and pastels. In 2019, she pursued a master's degree in applied mathematics but later decided to focus entirely on her passion for painting. After relocating to Vienna in 2021, she continued her artistic development through online courses and mentorship under a professional artist, delving into both practical techniques and art history.

Great! Do you want to start from scratch, or should we improve the current design? Also, do you have any specific sections in mind—like "About Me," "Gallery," or "Contact"?

ChatGPT said:
I've combined your "About" and "Contact" pages into a single document for easier editing. Let me know if you want to add more sections or enhance the design!






You said:
it seems that about in my website doesn't work well https://fateme-samare.github.io/about.html
ChatGPT said:
I understand you're experiencing issues accessing your "About" page at https://fateme-samare.github.io/about.html. After reviewing your site, I can confirm that the page is currently accessible and displays your biography as intended.

However, if you or your visitors encounter a "404 Not Found" error when trying to access this page, it could be due to the case sensitivity of URLs on GitHub Pages. For instance, /about.html is different from /About.html. Ensuring consistent lowercase usage in your URLs and filenames can help prevent such issues. 
HEARDLIBRARY.GITHUB.IO

To further enhance user experience and avoid potential case-sensitivity problems, consider implementing a custom 404 error page. This page can redirect users to the correct URL or provide navigation options to guide them. GitHub provides guidance on creating custom 404 pages.

If you continue to experience issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
